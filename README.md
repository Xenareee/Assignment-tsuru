A website for learning kanji, with a review system, kanji dictionary and more. The website's interface is in Polish. Made from scratch using PHP.

Inspired by language learning services like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/). The website's mascot is a red-crowned crane, which reflects the site's name, which means "crane" in Japanese.
